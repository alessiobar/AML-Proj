# AML-Project

This repository contains the code for the second homework of the *Advanced Machine Learning* course (10589621), Sapienza University. The group was composed by Francesco Redaelli, Giulio Pecile and me.

**TL;DR**: The assignments involved picking a novel algorithm from a top conference (eg. *ICML,NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV*), replicating its results, proposing a novel algorithmic approach, and conducting a detailed analysis of the new model.
